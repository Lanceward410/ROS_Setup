# ROS_Setup


By: Lance Ward

Welcome to ROS_Setup!
Run this file by navigating to the ~/ROS_Setup/scripts repository
and then running the start2.bash script, WITH flag "-ros1" or flag "-ros2" to select your desired ROS distro
Here is an example, if you are on Ubuntu 20, and would like to install ROS 2 Foxy:

~/ROS_Setup/scripts$   	bash start2.bash -ros2

Or, inside of any directory,

~$             	bash ~/ROS_Setup/scripts/start2.bash


In the other_scripts, there are scripts to:
1.) Repair sound issue due to over-amplification
2.) Create Git SSH key
3.) Gnome script
4.) set Git user
5.) Set up nvidia driver


In robot_readmes, you can find instructions and bash scripts for various robots 
that UMES is working with (Limo[melodic], Scout mini[melodic], Yahboom X1[melodic?noetic?], MicroROS[no sim yet], GoPiGo3[melodic])
